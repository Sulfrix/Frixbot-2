# Frixbot-2
A revival of an old project, Frixbot, a [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) bot.  

## Hosting
- Paste bot token in a file named `token.env`
- Run `npm install` (installs dependecies)
- Use `index.js` to start bot
## `config.json`
There isn't much in `config.json` but there are two values:
```json
{
  "owner": "<your id>",
  "mode": "['dev' or 'prod']"
}
```
`"mode"` is unused right now, but it is recommended to set it anyway as it might be used later.

---

### Note
*I will not be designing the bot to be ran by anyone but me. It is recommended that you know how to remove everything specific to me before hosting.*
